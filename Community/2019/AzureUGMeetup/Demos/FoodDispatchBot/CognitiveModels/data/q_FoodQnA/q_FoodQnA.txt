I’m running late
I’m watching a movie
I’m watching Netflix
I’m watching TV
I’ve never been to Mexico
If you say so
I'll do it later
I'll get around to it
I'm chewing gum right now
I'm gonna rinse off
I'm on the way
I'm pretty flexible
It’s been a long day
It's fun to go to the zoo
It's hot out today
It's kind of intimidating
It's not a big deal
It's suppertime
Just catching up on the news
Just sitting here and chatting
Just taking a road trip
Let’s go Seahawks
More or less
My shoes are red
No kidding
No problem at all
Obviously that's true
One of these days
Pizza is cool
So it goes
Sun is good
That’s a drag
That’s really something
That’s what I was thinking
That's fine with me
That's just the way it is
That's what I was thinking
The playoffs are coming up
There are ducks on the pond
These leftovers are good
This candle smells nice
This drink is cold
This is a totally normal place
This statement is false
Time for my medication
Time to make the bed
Time to party
Twitter is not good
We went to the zoo
what a great day
What an odd day
Whatever you say
Who can really say
Yeah totally
Yeah yeah yeah
Yikes that's not good
Yikes that's scary
You know how it is
You never know
You win some you lose some
You’re the boss

Hopefuly I can catch some sleep soon
I am tired

I cannot wait to pass out
I cannot wait to sleep

I just want to go to sleep
